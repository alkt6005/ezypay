Question 3:

Dear Mr.Client,

Good day!

We understand that you needed the report urgently to perform financial reconciliation but
Unfortunately the report took longer time than usual to generate due to performance issue. 

Preliminary investigation showed that the script that was used to generate the report has some issues. 
When the script runs, it's processing utilised a huge amount of CPU and memory hence causing the table in database table to be locked. 

At this point of time, we have allocated our best resources to fine tune the script so that it will be able
to generate the report quicker. Additionally we also will run a script to create more indexes as this will further speed up
the report generation. 

We have also prepared the timeline for this report issue, kindly refer to the below:
1) 24 March 2020 - we will fine tune the script to completion and test it in our environment
2) 25 March 2020 - subject to test results, we hope to be able to run the new script in Production environment

Rest assured that we are doing our best and hope to provide to you the script as soon as possible. 

Appreciate your kind understanding. 

Thank you.
